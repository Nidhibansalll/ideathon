# Ideathon

## Overview
This repository is a collection of data science and AI experiments, featuring a complete Machine Learning pipeline for **Walmart stock price prediction**. It covers data cleaning, building and training an ML model, and deploying evaluation scripts. Future goals include adding an AI chatbot to further enrich interactive capabilities.

## Key Features
- **Walmart Stock Price Prediction Model:** End-to-end process from raw data to deployed ML model.
    - Data cleaning and preprocessing (remove nulls, encoding, normalization).
    - Feature engineering for improved forecasting accuracy.
    - Model training and validation (Regression/Classification models).
    - Evaluation using metrics like RMSE, MAE, etc.
- **User Authentication System:** Secure logins for application flows.
- **Preprocessing Tools:** Ready-to-use encoders for categorical data (cities, products).
- **Ready-to-use Notebooks:** Jupyter Notebooks for demo, exploration, and reports.

## Technologies Used
- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn
- Pickle (for model serialization)
- ML Algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, RandomForest, etc.)

## Planned Models
- **AI Chatbot:** To be added soon for interactive user experience, customer support, and automation.

## Project Structure
- `.ipynb_checkpoints/` : Notebook autosaves
- `__pycache__/`         : Python cache files
- `*.csv`                : Walmart stock and other datasets
- `app.py`, `auth.py`    : Main application and authentication logic
- `help_demo.py`, `new.py`: Supporting scripts
- `*.pkl`                : Pre-trained encoder and ML model files
- `Untitled.ipynb`       : Demonstration and report notebook

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo:
2. Explore `Untitled.ipynb` for stock prediction workflow.
3. Run `app.py` and `auth.py` for the application and user management.
4. Check `.pkl` files for trained model usage.
5. Watch this repository for upcoming **AI chatbot** integration.

## Learning Outcomes
- Data cleaning and preprocessing for ML projects
- Feature engineering for better predictions
- Building, training, and evaluating ML models (supervised learning)
- Deploying models with Python scripts
- Planning and integrating chatbot/AI modules
